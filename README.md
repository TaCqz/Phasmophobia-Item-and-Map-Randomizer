## Feature Requests

If you have any requests or wishes for the program, please submit an issue on github. I'll review it and either implement it (if it is already
planned or if I like the idea), or i'll contact you. If it is not planned, nor do I deem it as a good idea, you can still choose to let me implement the feature
for you as a presonal request, which would cost some money. Im doing this in my free time, so there wont be weekly updates or something on those lines.
If I sleep past an update introducing new items/maps, submit an issue and I'll add them asap.
